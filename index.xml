      <title>Why Is Istio That Shape?</title>

Abstract Services Meshes are growing in relevance and adoption, as you can see from all the intro talks out there. But how do you build one of these things? Part network, part service discovery system, part logging adaptor, and 100% distributed system, it&amp;rsquo;s not easy. So why is the most popular service mesh, Istio, the shape it is?
We&amp;rsquo;ll see how the design fits the traditional three-tier model better than you think.</description>

      <title>Running Resilient Workloads with Istio</title>

Abstract Remember how cool Kubernetes seemed when you first started using it? A simple, easy API for scalable compute in any cloud: just a Deployment and a Service and youâ€™re done! But as you use it more, you learn that this isn&amp;rsquo;t really enough. A production system needs requests and limits, liveness checks, HPAs, PDBs, PSPs, etc.
The same is true for Istio, which can solve a lot of the problems with microservices out of the box, but isn&amp;rsquo;t magic.</description>

Abstract Iâ€™ll show what Istio is, and how it does what it does. Weâ€™ll explore that from the point of view of one packet travelling in from the internet and back out again, to show us all the major data and control plane components.

      <description>These are the days of VMs, containers, and service meshes. The network, for a long time the sysadmin&amp;rsquo;s mysterious domain, is now at the fore-front: providing overlays, security features, and headaches. It&amp;rsquo;s vital to be able to understand what&amp;rsquo;s going on under the hood of a cloud-native platform if you ever hope to debug it, but do you know a TAP from a TUN, let alone an ipvlanL3? This talk will take you through all the network interface types on modern linux, from good old eth0 to the vEths used by Docker and the tunnels used by Calico.</description>

Abstract Service meshes are cool, but are they useful? We&amp;rsquo;ll explore what a service mesh is and what they can do for your microservices. Are the claims of observability, resiliency, and WAF features real? Are they useful during development, production, or both? Using pictures and demos, we&amp;rsquo;ll find out!

&amp;mdash; Chris Aniszczyk (@cra) September 24, 2018  Abstract The Istio project reached 1.0 this summer, and is mature enough to have LTS releases. It&amp;rsquo;s getting a lot of attention, but in a lot of ways it&amp;rsquo;s still a mystery.</description>

Abstract Istio is a service mesh for Kubernetes that offers advanced networking features. It provides intelligent routing, resiliency, and security features, so that service authors don&amp;rsquo;t have to keep re-implementing them. Istio is rapidly taking off and there are great introductory talks everywhere. However in this session, we will dive deep to explore precisely how it does what it does, following one brave little packet in from the internet and back out again.</description>

      <description>Video Alas the videographers let us down.
Session Information Meetup Link
Abstract Cross-cluster / VPC / Data Center connectivity is a huge problem. Current solutions are clunky and unreliable, using VPNs, DirectConnects, or sending everything out to the internet and back through the ingress layer. Some solutions have been attempted with Service Meshes, but these all involve a shared control plane, causing bit problems for latency, security, and reliability.</description>

Abstract Everyone says they&amp;rsquo;re coding in Rust these days, but they&amp;rsquo;re not. Every system has some bash-flavoured blu-tack hiding in the corners. But how well do you know this arcane, abstruse, annoying programming language? In 5 minutes, I&amp;rsquo;ll educate, entertain, and inform you about a core part of the bash language - the simple conditional statement. This irreverent and funny talk, while yes, insulting bash quite a lot, will hopefully provide a whole bunch of &amp;ldquo;oh, that&amp;rsquo;s why it does that&amp;rdquo; moments too.</description>

Abstract The network is back. But is it useful?
We&amp;rsquo;ll explore what a service mesh is and what they can do for your microservice web backends. Are the claims of observability, resiliency, and WAF features real? Are they useful during development, production, or both? Using pictures and demos, we&amp;rsquo;ll find out!
This session will also briefly cover how a service mesh works, giving us a mental model with which to explore and evaluate after the talk.</description>

Abstract Writing a filesystem can be very cool. Alas, writing a filesystem is also very hard. This is mainly because coding in the kernel is hard. Thankfully, most of the pain can be avoided by using a library like FUSE. Such libraries enable filesystems to be expressed as simple userspace programmes by taking care of all that tedious mucking about in kernel space.
This talk will look at the Why and How of such filesystem development, using FUSE on UNIX.</description>
