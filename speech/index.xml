      <description>Abstract Istio is a service mesh for Kubernetes that offers advanced networking features. It provides intelligent routing, resiliency, and security features, so that service authors don&amp;rsquo;t have to keep re-implementing them. Istio is rapidly taking off and there are great introductory talks everywhere. However in this session, we will explore precisely how it does what it does, following one brave little packet in from the internet and back out again.</description>

      <title>Bash is Testing</title>

      <description>Abstract Everyone says they&amp;rsquo;re coding in Rust these days, but they&amp;rsquo;re not. Every system has some bash-flavoured blu-tack hiding in the corners. But how well do you know this arcane, abstruse, annoying programming language? In 5 minutes, I&amp;rsquo;ll educate, entertain, and inform you about a core part of the bash language - the simple conditional statement. This irreverent and funny talk, while yes, insulting bash quite a lot, will hopefully provide a whole bunch of &amp;ldquo;oh, that&amp;rsquo;s why it does that&amp;rdquo; moments too.</description>

      <title>Do you need a Service Mesh?</title>
      <link>https://mt165.co.uk/speech/do-you-need-a-service-mesh/</link>

      <description>Abstract The network is back. But is it useful? We&amp;rsquo;ll explore what a service mesh is and what they can do for your microservice web backends. Are the claims of observability, resiliency, and WAF features real? Are they useful during development, production, or both? Using pictures and demos, we&amp;rsquo;ll find out!</description>
